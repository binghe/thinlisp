1.0.1

The first line of this file should contain the version number for ThinLisp.
This is used when creating the names for distribution tarballs and zip files.
This version number must also be updated by hand within docs/tl-manual.texinfo
and within the function LISP-IMPLEMENTATION-VERSION in tl/lisp/tl-basics.lisp
before you make the release.

To issue a new release, update the version numbers as described above, tag the
sources with the new version using a tag of the following form.

  TL-<version-using-only-hyphens>-BASE

To tag the sources, check out the appropriate versions of all of the files that
you want included in the release (usually this means the head versions of all
files), and then run the following command.

  cvs tag TL-<version>-BASE

The base tag is made so that a branch can be made off of this tag later if there
is a need to issue a patch to this release.  From within the src directory of a
checked out source repository, run the following command to create a new
exported src directory.

  cvs export -r TL-<version>-BASE -d src thinlisp-1.0/src

Then run a "make distribution" to make a new directory called "dist" within the
sandbox src directory.  The dist directory will contain the files for a new
distribution of a ThinLisp release.  Once done copying those files to your
release site, you'll need to delete the dist and thinlisp-* directories created
by this process.
