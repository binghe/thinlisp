<P>Of course this is ignoring
other, more broadly applicable developments, such as multi-tasking operating
systems.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="tl-manual.html#DOCF2">(2)</A></H3>
<P>All apologies in advance
to my father-in-law Ed (a scientist) and my brother-in-law Holger (a
mathematician) from me (an engineer).

<P>In the rest of this discussion, the scientist has gone for coffee,
uninterested because there is nothing pre-existing to study, only new things
being spun out of the air.

<P>For consing operations that can be called from either context, you can
declare a consing area of <CODE>either</CODE>, but in practice that is fairly rare.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT6" HREF="tl-manual.html#DOCF6">(6)</A></H3>
<P>There is an argument that they should be aligned on 8 byte
addresses.  There are two advantages to 8 byte alignment.  One is that it would
enable us to reliably store immediate double floats and pointers into the same
array.  The second is that it would can give us an immediate type tag for conses
that is itself the offset to the cdr of a cons.  The argument for 4 byte
alignment is that all current C compilers we use align structures on 4 byte
addresses, but some won't align them on 8 byte addresses, even if they contain
doubles.  The other argument for 4 byte alignment is that we would not need to
occasionally skip forward 4 bytes when allocating from heap in order to find the
next 8 byte aligned address.  For now, the 4 byte alignment wins.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT7" HREF="tl-manual.html#DOCF7">(7)</A></H3>
<P>Kim Barrett recently made a convincing argument for an immediate type
tag of zero for fixnums.  With this approach there is no bit fiddling needed for
fixnum numeric operations.  I had originally dismissed this approach since it
would require pointer arithmatic to be done to fetch the type tag of an object.
However, since most processors have a single instruction that can fetch from an
address plus offset, this becomes a moot point.  For now, the existing scheme
carries the day due to inertia.  -jallard, 10/31/99

<P>The Alpha OSF has since been renamed DEC UNIX.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT9" HREF="tl-manual.html#DOCF9">(9)</A></H3>
<P>The following comment applies only to 8 byte alignment: For
example, we could put immediate floats into odd-indexed simple vector locations,
and those floats would consume 2 elements.  For structures and frames, this
could provide significant savings.  -jra 8/30/95

<P>This note about classes is being written in anticipation of their
implementation.  -jallard 10/29/99
<H3><A NAME="FOOT11" HREF="tl-manual.html#DOCF11">(11)</A></H3>
<P>This latter idea of having a
"reclaimed flag" has never been implemented.  -jallard 10/12/99
<H3><A NAME="FOOT12" HREF="tl-manual.html#DOCF12">(12)</A></H3>
<P>Rest
arguments have since been added.  -jallard 10/9/99.
